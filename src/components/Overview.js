                  BAYC is a collection of 10,000 Bored Ape NFTs—unique digital
                  collectibles living on the Ethereum blockchain. Your Bored Ape
                  doubles as your Yacht Club membership card, and grants access
                  to members-only benefits, the first of which is access to THE
                  BATHROOM, a collaborative graffiti board. Future areas and
                  perks can be unlocked by the community through roadmap
                  activation.
